# Todo List with Database App
This is a ToDo List with database built in that I created from Tyler Potts tutorial on HTML, CSS & JavaScript. Here's a link to his video if you're interested: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eFwtaZf6zc&t=0s. All your tasks can be divided into business or personal task that will automatically save (won't be deleted). Hope you enjoy!
